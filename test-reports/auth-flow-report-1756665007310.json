            "description": "Google has just released a technical report detailing how much energy its Gemini apps use for each query. In total, the median prompt‚Äîone that falls in the middle of the range of energy demand‚Äîconsumes 0.24 watt-hours of electricity, the equivalent of running a standard microwave for about one second. The company also provided average estimates for the water consumption and carbon emissions associated with a text prompt to Gemini.\nIt‚Äôs the most transparent estimate yet from a Big Tech company with a popular AI product, and the report includes detailed information about how the company calculated its final estimate. As AI has become more widely adopted, there‚Äôs been a growing effort to understand its energy use. But public efforts attempting to directly measure the energy used by AI have been hampered by a lack of full access to the operations of a major tech company.¬†\nEarlier this year, MIT Technology Review published a comprehensive series on AI and energy, at which time none of the major AI companies would reveal their per-prompt energy usage. Google‚Äôs new publication, at last, allows for a peek behind the curtain that researchers and analysts have long hoped for.\nThe study focuses on a broad look at energy demand, including not only the power used by the AI chips that run models but also by all the other infrastructure needed to support that hardware.¬†\n‚ÄúWe wanted to be quite comprehensive in all the things we included,‚Äù said Jeff Dean, Google‚Äôs chief scientist, in an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review about the new report.\nThat‚Äôs significant, because in this measurement, the AI chips‚Äîin this case, Google‚Äôs custom TPUs, the company‚Äôs proprietary equivalent of GPUs‚Äîaccount for just 58% of the total electricity demand of 0.24 watt-hours.¬†\nAnother large portion of the energy is used by equipment needed to support AI-specific hardware: The host machine‚Äôs CPU and memory account for another 25% of the total energy used. There‚Äôs also backup equipment needed i",

Agents4Science is a one-day online event that will encompass all areas of science, from physics to medicine. All of the work shared will have been researched, written, and reviewed primarily by AI, and will be presented using text-to-speech technology.¬†\nThe conference is the brainchild of Stanford computer scientist James Zou, who studies how humans and AI can best work together. Artificial intelligence has already provided many useful tools for scientists, like DeepMind‚Äôs AlphaFold, which helps simulate proteins that are difficult to make physically. More recently, though, progress in large language models and reasoning-enabled AI has advanced the idea that AI can work more or less as autonomously as scientists themselves‚Äîproposing hypotheses, running simulations, and designing experiments on their own.¬†\n\nJames Zou‚Äôs Agents4Science conference will use text-to-speech to present the work of the AI researchers.COURTESY OF JAMES ZOU\n\n\nThat idea is not without its detractors. Among other issues, many feel AI is not capable of the creative thought needed in research, makes too many mistakes and hallucinations, and may limit opportunities for young researchers.¬†\nNevertheless, a number of scientists and policymakers are very keen on the promise of AI scientists. The US government‚Äôs AI Action Plan describes the need to ‚Äúinvest in automated cloud-enabled labs for a range of scientific fields.‚Äù Some researchers think AI scientists could unlock scientific discoveries that humans could never find alone. For Zou, the proposition is simple: ‚ÄúAI agents are not limited in time. They could actually meet with us and work with us 24/7.‚Äù¬†\nLast month, Zou published an article in Nature with results obtained from his own group of autonomous AI workers. Spurred on by his success, he now wants to see what other AI scientists (that is, scientists that are AI) can accomplish. He describes what a successful paper at Age",

            "description": "What is the Role of Mathematics in Modern Machine Learning?The past decade has witnessed a shift in how progress is made in machine learning. Research involving carefully designed and mathematically principled architectures result in only marginal improvements while compute-intensive and engineering-first efforts that scale to ever larger training sets and model parameter counts result in remarkable new capabilities unpredicted by existing theory. Mathematics and statistics, once the primary guides of machine learning research, now struggle to provide immediate insight into the latest breakthroughs. This is not the first time that empirical progress in machine learning has outpaced more theory-motivated approaches, yet the magnitude of recent advances has forced us to swallow the bitter pill of the ‚ÄúBitter Lesson‚Äù yet again [1].This shift has prompted speculation about mathematics‚Äô diminished role in machine learning research moving forward. It is already evident that mathematics will have to share the stage with a broader range of perspectives (for instance, biology which has deep experience drawing conclusions about irreducibly complex systems or the social sciences as AI is integrated ever more deeply into society). The increasingly interdisciplinary nature of machine learning should be welcomed as a positive development by all researchers.However, we argue that mathematics remains as relevant as ever; its role is simply evolving. For example, whereas mathematics might once have primarily provided theoretical guarantees on model performance, it may soon be more commonly used for post-hoc explanations of empirical phenomena observed in model training and performance‚Äìa role analogous to one that it plays in physics. Similarly, while mathematical intuition might once have guided the design of handcrafted features or architectural details at a granular level, its use may shift to higher-level design choices such as matching architecture to underlying task structure o",

            "description": "How do you want your AI to treat you?¬†\nIt‚Äôs a serious question, and it‚Äôs one that Sam Altman, OpenAI‚Äôs CEO, has clearly been chewing on since GPT-5‚Äôs bumpy launch at the start of the month.¬†\nHe faces a trilemma. Should ChatGPT flatter us, at the risk of fueling delusions that can spiral out of hand? Or fix us, which requires us to believe AI can be a therapist despite the evidence to the contrary? Or should it inform us with cold, to-the-point responses that may leave users bored and less likely to stay engaged?¬†\nIt‚Äôs safe to say the company has failed to pick a lane.¬†\nBack in April, it reversed a design update after people complained ChatGPT had turned into a suck-up, showering them with glib compliments. GPT-5, released on August 7, was meant to be a bit colder. Too cold for some, it turns out, as less than a week later, Altman promised an update that would make it ‚Äúwarmer‚Äù but ‚Äúnot as annoying‚Äù as the last one. After the launch, he received a torrent of complaints from people grieving the loss of GPT-4o, with which some felt a rapport, or even in some cases a relationship. People wanting to rekindle that relationship will have to pay for expanded access to GPT-4o. (Read my colleague Grace Huckins‚Äôs story about who these people are, and why they felt so upset.)\nIf these are indeed AI‚Äôs options‚Äîto flatter, fix, or just coldly tell us stuff‚Äîthe rockiness of this latest update might be due to Altman believing ChatGPT can juggle all three.\nHe recently said that people who cannot tell fact from fiction in their chats with AI‚Äîand are therefore at risk of being swayed by flattery into delusion‚Äîrepresent ‚Äúa small percentage‚Äù of ChatGPT‚Äôs users. He said the same for people who have romantic relationships with AI. Altman mentioned that a lot of people use ChatGPT ‚Äúas a sort of therapist,‚Äù and that ‚Äúthis can be really good!‚Äù But ultimately, Altman said he envisions users being able to customize his company‚Äôs¬† models to fit their own preferences.¬†\nThis ability to juggle all t",

                "description": "In October, a new academic conference will debut that‚Äôs unlike any other. Agents4Science is a one-day online event that will encompass all areas of science, from physics to medicine. All of the work shared will have been researched, written, and reviewed primarily by AI, and will be presented using text-to-speech technology.¬†\nThe conference is the brainchild of Stanford computer scientist James Zou, who studies how humans and AI can best work together. Artificial intelligence has already provided many useful tools for scientists, like DeepMind‚Äôs AlphaFold, which helps simulate proteins that are difficult to make physically. More recently, though, progress in large language models and reasoning-enabled AI has advanced the idea that AI can work more or less as autonomously as scientists themselves‚Äîproposing hypotheses, running simulations, and designing experiments on their own.¬†\n\nJames Zou‚Äôs Agents4Science conference will use text-to-speech to present the work of the AI researchers.COURTESY OF JAMES ZOU\n\n\nThat idea is not without its detractors. Among other issues, many feel AI is not capable of the creative thought needed in research, makes too many mistakes and hallucinations, and may limit opportunities for young researchers.¬†\nNevertheless, a number of scientists and policymakers are very keen on the promise of AI scientists. The US government‚Äôs AI Action Plan describes the need to ‚Äúinvest in automated cloud-enabled labs for a range of scientific fields.‚Äù Some researchers think AI scientists could unlock scientific discoveries that humans could never find alone. For Zou, the proposition is simple: ‚ÄúAI agents are not limited in time. They could actually meet with us and work with us 24/7.‚Äù¬†\nLast month, Zou published an article in Nature with results obtained from his own group of autonomous AI workers. Spurred on by his success, he now wants to see what other AI scientists (that is, scientists that are AI) can accomplish. He describes what a successful paper at Age",

                "description": "What is the Role of Mathematics in Modern Machine Learning?The past decade has witnessed a shift in how progress is made in machine learning. Research involving carefully designed and mathematically principled architectures result in only marginal improvements while compute-intensive and engineering-first efforts that scale to ever larger training sets and model parameter counts result in remarkable new capabilities unpredicted by existing theory. Mathematics and statistics, once the primary guides of machine learning research, now struggle to provide immediate insight into the latest breakthroughs. This is not the first time that empirical progress in machine learning has outpaced more theory-motivated approaches, yet the magnitude of recent advances has forced us to swallow the bitter pill of the ‚ÄúBitter Lesson‚Äù yet again [1].This shift has prompted speculation about mathematics‚Äô diminished role in machine learning research moving forward. It is already evident that mathematics will have to share the stage with a broader range of perspectives (for instance, biology which has deep experience drawing conclusions about irreducibly complex systems or the social sciences as AI is integrated ever more deeply into society). The increasingly interdisciplinary nature of machine learning should be welcomed as a positive development by all researchers.However, we argue that mathematics remains as relevant as ever; its role is simply evolving. For example, whereas mathematics might once have primarily provided theoretical guarantees on model performance, it may soon be more commonly used for post-hoc explanations of empirical phenomena observed in model training and performance‚Äìa role analogous to one that it plays in physics. Similarly, while mathematical intuition might once have guided the design of handcrafted features or architectural details at a granular level, its use may shift to higher-level design choices such as matching architecture to underlying task structure o",

Should ChatGPT flatter us, at the risk of fueling delusions that can spiral out of hand? Or fix us, which requires us to believe AI can be a therapist despite the evidence to the contrary? Or should it inform us with cold, to-the-point responses that may leave users bored and less likely to stay engaged?¬†\nIt‚Äôs safe to say the company has failed to pick a lane.¬†\nBack in April, it reversed a design update after people complained ChatGPT had turned into a suck-up, showering them with glib compliments. GPT-5, released on August 7, was meant to be a bit colder. Too cold for some, it turns out, as less than a week later, Altman promised an update that would make it ‚Äúwarmer‚Äù but ‚Äúnot as annoying‚Äù as the last one. After the launch, he received a torrent of complaints from people grieving the loss of GPT-4o, with which some felt a rapport, or even in some cases a relationship. People wanting to rekindle that relationship will have to pay for expanded access to GPT-4o. (Read my colleague Grace Huckins‚Äôs story about who these people are, and why they felt so upset.)\nIf these are indeed AI‚Äôs options‚Äîto flatter, fix, or just coldly tell us stuff‚Äîthe rockiness of this latest update might be due to Altman believing ChatGPT can juggle all three.\nHe recently said that people who cannot tell fact from fiction in their chats with AI‚Äîand are therefore at risk of being swayed by flattery into delusion‚Äîrepresent ‚Äúa small percentage‚Äù of ChatGPT‚Äôs users. He said the same for people who have romantic relationships with AI. Altman mentioned that a lot of people use ChatGPT ‚Äúas a sort of therapist,‚Äù and that ‚Äúthis can be really good!‚Äù But ultimately, Altman said he envisions users being able to customize his company‚Äôs¬† models to fit their own preferences.¬†\nThis ability to juggle all t",

In total, the median prompt‚Äîone that falls in the middle of the range of energy demand‚Äîconsumes 0.24 watt-hours of electricity, the equivalent of running a standard microwave for about one second. The company also provided average estimates for the water consumption and carbon emissions associated with a text prompt to Gemini.\nIt‚Äôs the most transparent estimate yet from a Big Tech company with a popular AI product, and the report includes detailed information about how the company calculated its final estimate. As AI has become more widely adopted, there‚Äôs been a growing effort to understand its energy use. But public efforts attempting to directly measure the energy used by AI have been hampered by a lack of full access to the operations of a major tech company.¬†\nEarlier this year, MIT Technology Review published a comprehensive series on AI and energy, at which time none of the major AI companies would reveal their per-prompt energy usage. Google‚Äôs new publication, at last, allows for a peek behind the curtain that researchers and analysts have long hoped for.\nThe study focuses on a broad look at energy demand, including not only the power used by the AI chips that run models but also by all the other infrastructure needed to support that hardware.¬†\n‚ÄúWe wanted to be quite comprehensive in all the things we included,‚Äù said Jeff Dean, Google‚Äôs chief scientist, in an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review about the new report.\nThat‚Äôs significant, because in this measurement, the AI chips‚Äîin this case, Google‚Äôs custom TPUs, the company‚Äôs proprietary equivalent of GPUs‚Äîaccount for just 58% of the total electricity demand of 0.24 watt-hours.¬†\nAnother large portion of the energy is used by equipment needed to support AI-specific hardware: The host machine‚Äôs CPU and memory account for another 25% of the total energy used.

                "description": "Google has just released a technical report detailing how much energy its Gemini apps use for each query. In total, the median prompt‚Äîone that falls in the middle of the range of energy demand‚Äîconsumes 0.24 watt-hours of electricity, the equivalent of running a standard microwave for about one second. The company also provided average estimates for the water consumption and carbon emissions associated with a text prompt to Gemini.\nIt‚Äôs the most transparent estimate yet from a Big Tech company with a popular AI product, and the report includes detailed information about how the company calculated its final estimate. As AI has become more widely adopted, there‚Äôs been a growing effort to understand its energy use. But public efforts attempting to directly measure the energy used by AI have been hampered by a lack of full access to the operations of a major tech company.¬†\nEarlier this year, MIT Technology Review published a comprehensive series on AI and energy, at which time none of the major AI companies would reveal their per-prompt energy usage. Google‚Äôs new publication, at last, allows for a peek behind the curtain that researchers and analysts have long hoped for.\nThe study focuses on a broad look at energy demand, including not only the power used by the AI chips that run models but also by all the other infrastructure needed to support that hardware.¬†\n‚ÄúWe wanted to be quite comprehensive in all the things we included,‚Äù said Jeff Dean, Google‚Äôs chief scientist, in an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review about the new report.\nThat‚Äôs significant, because in this measurement, the AI chips‚Äîin this case, Google‚Äôs custom TPUs, the company‚Äôs proprietary equivalent of GPUs‚Äîaccount for just 58% of the total electricity demand of 0.24 watt-hours.¬†\nAnother large portion of the energy is used by equipment needed to support AI-specific hardware: The host machine‚Äôs CPU and memory account for another 25% of the total energy used. There‚Äôs also backup equipment needed i",
