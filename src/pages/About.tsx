            <h2>The Need for One Source of Truth</h2>
            <p>
              The artificial intelligence landscape is expanding at breakneck speed. Every day, groundbreaking research emerges from universities, 
              startups announce revolutionary products, tech giants release game-changing models, and policy makers shape the future of AI governance. 
              This information is scattered across hundreds of sources - research papers, tech blogs, news sites, social media, conference proceedings, 
              and industry reports.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The problem?</strong> Staying informed requires monitoring dozens of sources, consuming hours daily, 
              and risking information overload or missing critical developments. Most professionals and enthusiasts resort to fragmented 
              news consumption, leading to incomplete understanding and missed opportunities.
